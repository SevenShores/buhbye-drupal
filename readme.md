# Jason Versus Drupal

A module for displaying drupal content as JSON.

This makes it easy to get all the stuff you want in a way that is easy to grab and import into your own database.

That's how we used it but you can use it however you want.

### Installation

Upload this jason-vs-drupal directory to `sites/all/modules/jason` and enable the module.
